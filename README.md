# House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project demonstrates how to predict house prices based on their size (in square feet) using a simple linear regression model. The model is trained on a sample dataset of house sizes and their corresponding prices.

## Project Overview

In this project, we use **Linear Regression** to create a model that predicts the price of a house based on its size. The goal is to learn the relationship between the size of the house and its price and use this knowledge to predict the price of new houses.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of the following:

- **X (Features)**: The size of the house in square feet.
- **y (Target)**: The corresponding price of the house in thousands of dollars.

### Sample Data:

| Size (sq. ft.) | Price (in thousands) |
|----------------|----------------------|
| 1400           | 245                  |
| 1600           | 312                  |
| 1700           | 279                  |
| 1875           | 308                  |
| 1100           | 199                  |
| 1550           | 219                  |
| 2350           | 405                  |
| 2450           | 324                  |
| 1425           | 319                  |
| 1700           | 255                  |

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The programming language used for implementing the model.
- **NumPy**: For handling arrays and data manipulation.
- **Scikit-learn**: A machine learning library that provides tools for creating and training the linear regression model.
- **Matplotlib** (Optional, for visualization): To plot data points and the regression line (not included in the base code).

## Installation

To run this project locally, you need to have Python installed along with the necessary libraries.

1. **Clone this repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/house-price-prediction.git
   cd house-price-prediction
   ```

2. **Install dependencies** using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Python script** to train the model and predict house prices:

   ```bash
   python house_price_prediction.py
   ```

   This will output the predicted price of a house with a size of 2000 square feet based on the linear regression model.

2. **Example output**:
   
   ```bash
   Predicted price for a 2000 sq. ft. house: 270.63
   ```

## Code Explanation

1. **Data**:
   - The dataset is represented by two NumPy arrays: `X` (house sizes) and `y` (prices).
   - `X` is reshaped to ensure it has the correct format for training the linear regression model.

2. **Model**:
   - A linear regression model is created using `LinearRegression()` from Scikit-learn.
   - The model is trained on the data using `model.fit(X, y)`.

3. **Prediction**:
   - The model predicts the price of a house with a size of 2000 square feet using `model.predict([[2000]])`.

## Future Improvements

- **Expand the dataset**: More data would improve the model's accuracy and robustness.
- **Multiple Features**: Use more features (e.g., number of bedrooms, location, etc.) for a more complex model.
- **Model Evaluation**: Implement techniques like cross-validation and evaluation metrics (e.g., Mean Squared Error) to assess model performance.
- **Visualization**: Plot the data and the regression line to better understand the model's predictions.
